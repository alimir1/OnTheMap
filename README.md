## About this app
This app has a map that shows information posted by other students. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. Users are able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL. Udacity students have an opportunity to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework.

## What I learned

* Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
